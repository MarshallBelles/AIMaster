# UserPortal Analysis Test

To test the enhanced coder agent with UserPortal, you can now use the server API:

## Via Server API (Recommended for Autonomous Operation)

```bash
# Test the coder agent with UserPortal analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/coder/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Navigate to /Users/marshallbelles/UserPortal and analyze the workspace. Use getCurrentDirectory, changeDirectory, and listDirectory tools. Tell me what kind of project this is and its main components."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Via Direct Script

```bash
# Initialize and test with script
npm run test-coder
```

## System Status

✅ **Coder Agent**: Available at http://localhost:4111/api/agents/coder  
✅ **MCP Tools**: Enhanced directory navigation, git operations  
✅ **Configuration**: Temperature 0.1, 4096 max tokens  
✅ **Model**: qwen-2-5-coder on Arbiter2:8080  

The agent now has:
- Rich context with all MCP tool descriptions
- Enhanced file operations with directory context
- Git workflow capabilities
- Cross-repository development support
- Optimized for autonomous, precise code generation

The initial response will take 45+ seconds due to the rich context and low temperature (0.1), but this ensures high-quality, precise analysis and code generation for autonomous operation.
